### Top 200 Words Preferred Briefs
What is this for? The top 200 words aren't as heavily briefed as I'd like. I dabble around the IT and tech side, so the tech-based common words like program, system and develop are good for me. Here are the explanations of each brief:

There are entries that are not within the english 200 word list in monkey type. 1) This is because some briefs are swapped, or 2)it is related to a specific word in the list.
1. line vs license. I know I'm not going to use license anymore than line, but the brief for license is much more simpler than line. The original lapwing/plover brief for license is `HR-PB`, whereas line is `HRAOUEUPB`. This swapping is merely for speed and convience reasons. "license" is changed to "HR-PBS".
2. make vs makes vs made. make is within the top 200 word list, and I've tried to make it left hand only, which can boost speed. It is readjusted to "KPH", which allows for "KPH-S" and "KPH-D" to be makes and made respectively.
2. Another example of 2) is increase vs decrease. I found that the original way of typing them was quite hard, so I made a easier version where I can easily type this in one stroke: "K*RS" and "K*RT" for increase and decrease.
