# Stenography-Dictionaries
This is my dictionary bank. I do intend to make it such that the dictionaries do not conflict with my base dictionary, which is the lapwing theory, a plover-based theory that has some inconsistency and mis-stroke entries removed. There are some categories of my dictionary available:

## Single stroke Pronouns

I've created this in part of creating the dictionaries for monkeytype. However, the thought process behind it was to create multiple easy to hit briefs regarding pronouns. Some examples are:
- `S`: "she"
- `H`: "he"
- `S-S`:" she has"
- `H-S`: "he has"
... and so on, for the ending `D` representing had, `Z` representing has, and `F` representing have. Quite a simple and short dictionary.

### Top 200 Words Preferred Briefs

What is this for? The top 200 words aren't as heavily briefed as I'd like. I dabble around the IT and tech side, so the tech-based common words like "program", "system", and "develop" are good for me.
Most of these briefs are derived from dropping the vowels, or some sounds/words in between. 
Here are the explanations of each brief:

- `ST-L`: "still" - The `ST` phonetically linked to the `st` in "still", and the `-L` represents the ending `l`.
- `SKWR`: "just" - The `SKWR` phonetically represents the sound of `j` in "just".
- `SKWR-L`: "general" - Building on the previous shorthand, `-L` used for the `l` sound.
- `SP`: "and" - The original `SKP` is changed to `SP` for speed and convienence.
- `SPH-L`: "small" - The `SPH` is chosen for its phonetic similarity to `sm`, and `-L` for the `l` in "small".
- `SHE`: "she" - Represents the word "she". However, in the `single stroke pronoun briefs`, the S is changed to she, and -S is changed to is.
- `SR-R`: "over" - The `SR` represents the `ov` in "over", and `-R` the ending `r`.
- `SAEUPL`: "Sam" - The `SAE` represent the `sa` in "Sam", and `UPL` the `m`.
- `SAPL`: "same" - The `SA` for the `sa` in "same", and `PL` for the `me`. "same" receives a shorter brief because it is more common than the name Sam.
- `SE`: "see" - Speed and Convinence.
- `S-FP`: "such" - The `S-` prefix represents `s`, and `-FP` might represent the `ch` sound.
- `S-PBS`: "since" - The `S-` prefix represents `s`, and `-PBS` represent the `nce`.
- `S-L`: "school" - Speed and Convinence.
- `TKPWR-P`: "group" - The combination of `TKPWR` phonetically represent `gr`, and `-P` the ending `p`.
- `TKPWR-T`: "great" - Building on the previous shorthand, `-T` represent the ending `t`.
- `TKPW-F`: "give" - Building on the previous shorthand,`-F` represents the ending `ve`.
- `TKA`: "take" - Speed and Convinence.
- `TK-PB`: "down" - The `TK-` prefix represent the `d`, and `-PB` the `own`.
- `TPH-PL`: "number" - The `TPH` represent the `n`, and `-PL` the `m`.
- `TP-FT`: "first" - The `TP-` prefix represents `f`, and `-FT` represents the `irst`.
- `THES`: "these" - Phonetically, `THES` represents "these".
- `TH-G`: "thing" - The `TH-` prefix represents `th`, and `-G` represents the ending `g`.
- `TA`: "that" - Phonetically, `TA` represents "that".
- `T-PL`: "time" - The `T-` prefix represents `t`, and `-PL` represent the `ime`.
- `KPH`: "make" - `PH` represents `m` and `K` represents `K`. By violating the steno order for this very common word, we can craft make with a one-handed comfortable to press `KPH`.
- `KPH-S`: "makes" - Building on the previous shorthand, `-S` represents the ending `s`.
- `KPH-D`: "made" - Building on the previous shorthand, `-D` represents the past tense.
- `KH-PBG`: "change" - The `KH` represent the `ch`, and `-PBG` the `nge`.
- `KH-LD`: "child" - The `KH` represents the `ch`, and `-LD` the `ld`.
- `K*RS`: "increase" - `K*RS` phonetically represents the sound of "increase".
- `K*RT`: "decrease" - "decrease" could be assigned to `K*RD`, but that would just be harder to reach. `T` is easier to reach and just above `S`, which is for increase.
- `PWAOEPB`: "been" - Phonetically, `PWAOEPB` represents "been".
- `PWO`: "both" - Phonetically, `PWO` represents "both".
- `PWEPB`: "Ben" - Phonetically, `PWEPB` represents "Ben". 
- `PW-PB`: "between" - The `PW-` prefix represent the `be`, and `-PB` the `en`.
- `PH`: "many" - `PH` represents `m`, and "many" has a more intensive stroke compared to other common words like make, so the base m brief is assigned to many.
- `PHO`: "more" - Speed and Convinence.
- `PR`: "from" - Speed and Convinence.
- `PROB`: "problem" - What's your prob?
- `PR-T`: "present" - The `PR-` prefix represent `pr`, and `-T` the `ent`.
- `PR-TS`: "presentation" - Building on the previous shorthand, the additional `-S` represents the `ation`.
- `PUBL`: "public" - Phonetically, `PUBL` represents "public".
- `P-R`: "for" - Phonetically, `P-R` represents "for".
- `P-RPB`: "person" - The `P-` prefix represent the `p`, and `-RPB` the `rson`.
- `P-T`: "point" - Speed and Convinence.
- `P-D`: "find" - Speed and Convinence.
- `WRER`: "year" - Speed and Convinence.
- `WOD`: "word" - Phonetically, `WOD` represents "word".
- `WE`: "we" - Phonetically, `WE` represents "we".
- `W-BG`: "work" - The `W-` prefix represents `w`, and `-BG` represents the `k`.
- `W-L`: "while" - The `W-` prefix represents `wh`, and `-L` the ending `le`.
- `W-D`: "world" - The `W-` prefix represents `w`, and `-D` represents the `d`. Now granted, the original `WORLD` isn't very hard to type, but this would just be for the Speed and Convinence.
- `HRARG`: "large" - Phonetically, `HRARG` represents "large".
- `HR-F`: "leave" - The `HR-` prefix represent the `le`, and `-F` the `ve`.
- `HR-PB`: "line" - The `HR-` prefix represent the `li`, and `-PB` the `ne`.
- `HR-PBS`: "license" - The `HR-` prefix represent the `li`, and `-PBS` the `cense`.
- `HR-BG`: "like" - The `HR-` prefix represent the `li`, and `-BG` the `ke`.
- `H-FR`: "however" - The `H-` prefix represent the `ho`, and `-FR` the `wever`.
- `H-R`: "here" - The `H-` prefix represents `h`, and `-R` represents the `re`.
- `O`: "on" - Phonetically, `O` represents "on".
- `OB`: "own" - Speed and Convinence.
- `ORPB`: "owner" - With some inversion, `ORPB` represents "owner".
- `OPBL`: "only" - Phonetically, `OPBL` represents "only".
- `E`: "each" - Phonetically, `E` represents "each". "he" has been readjusted to "H" within the `single stroke pronouns.json`
- `UFP`: "much" - Phonetically, `UFP` represents "much".
- `-FPB`: "even" - The `-FPB` represents "even".
- `-PB`: "an" - Phonetically, `-PB` represents "an".

## Additional Entries

There are entries that are not within the English 200 word list in MonkeyType. These entries fall into two categories:

1. **Swapped Briefs:** Some briefs have been swapped for speed and convenience reasons.
   - `license` vs `line`: The original Lapwing/Plover brief for `license` is `HR-PB`, while `line` is `HRAOUEUPB`. For speed and convenience, `license` is changed to `HR-PBS`.

2. **Related to Specific Words:** Some entries are related to specific words in the list.
   - `make` vs `makes` vs `made`: Since `make` is within the top 200 words, it's adjusted to the shorthand `KPH`, allowing `KPH-S` and `KPH-D` to represent `makes` and `made` respectively.
   - `increase` vs `decrease`: For easier typing, a simplified version is used: `K*RS` for `increase` and `K*RT` for `decrease`.

### Top 200 words phrasing
Now this dictionary is more intense, where we stroke phrases of these words combined from the top 200 list, such that with one stroke, we can stroke common phrases like "just that", "small house", "develop a new". This ensures that we are not only faster in the monkeytype test, but we actually gain some real world usage out of it.

- `SKWR-T`: "just that" - The `SKWR` stands for "just" and `-T` stands for "that". Together, they form the phrase "just that".
- `SPHAUS`: "small house" - The `SPH` stands for "small" and `AUS` phonetically represents "house".
- `SPH-RLD`: "small world" - The `SPH` stands for "small" and `-RLD` represents "world".
- `SHR-R`: "over here" - The `SHR` stands for "over" and `-R` represents "here".
- `SRAUPB`: "develop a new" - The `SR` represent "develop", `AU` stands for "a", `PB` stands for "new", and when put together they form "develop a new".
- `SR-PB`: "have been" - The `SR` stands for "have" and `-PB` represents "been".
- `SEU`: "see you" - The `SE` stands for "see" and `U` represents "you".
- `TKPWR-PBT`: "great interest" - The `TKPWR` stands for "great" and `-PBT` represents "interest".
- - `TKPW-D`: "good day" - The `TKPW` stands for "good" and `-D` represents "day".
- `TKPWR-D`: "great day" - The `TKPWR` stands for "great" and `-D` represents "day".
- `TPHAEUT`: "new state" - The `TPH` stands for "new" and `AEUT` represents "state".
- `TPHER`: "new year" - The `TPH` stands for "new" and `ER` represents "year".
- `TOEL`: "to tell" - The `TO` stands for "to" and `EL` represents "tell".
- `PEUBL`: "public eye" - The `P-UBL` stands for "public" and `E` represents "eye".
- `HRAOEUFT`: "last night" - The `HR----FT` stands for "last" and `AOEU` represents "night".
- `HROEU`: "long way" - The `HR` stands for "long" and `OEU` represents "way". It doesn't make much theory sense but this is due to other more suitable strokes being taken up.
- `RAOEURPB`: "right turn" - The `RAOEU` stands for "right" and `RPB` represents "turn".
- `RAEF`: "real life" - The `RAE` stands for "real" and `F` represents "life".
- `ROPB`: "right to know" - The `R` stands for "right", `O` represents "to", and `PB` is for "know".
- `AOL`: "old school" - The `AO` stands for "old" and `L` represents "school".
- `OPB`: "old man" - The `O` stands for "old" and `PB` represents "man". Note that "on" has been readjusted to `O` in the `top 200 word prefered briefs.json`
- `OUS`: "old house" - The `O` stands for "old" and `US` represents "house".
- `OPL`: "old system" - The `O` stands for "old" and `PL` represents "system".
