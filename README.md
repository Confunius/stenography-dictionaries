### Top 200 Words Preferred Briefs

What is this for? The top 200 words aren't as heavily briefed as I'd like. I dabble around the IT and tech side, so the tech-based common words like "program", "system", and "develop" are good for me.
Most of these briefs are derived from dropping the vowels, or some sounds/words in between. 
Here are the explanations of each brief:

- `ST-L`: "still" - The `ST` phonetically linked to the `st` in "still", and the `-L` represents the ending `l`.
- `SKWR`: "just" - The `SKWR` phonetically represents the sound of `j` in "just".
- `SKWR-L`: "general" - Building on the previous shorthand, `-L` used for the `l` sound.
- `SP`: "and" - The original `SKP` is changed to `SP` for speed and convienence.
- `SPH-L`: "small" - The `SPH` is chosen for its phonetic similarity to `sm`, and `-L` for the `l` in "small".
- `SHE`: "she" - Represents the word "she". However, in the `single stroke pronoun briefs`, the S is changed to she, and -S is changed to is.
- `SR-R`: "over" - The `SR` represents the `ov` in "over", and `-R` the ending `r`.
- `SAEUPL`: "Sam" - The `SAE` represent the `sa` in "Sam", and `UPL` the `m`.
- `SAPL`: "same" - The `SA` for the `sa` in "same", and `PL` for the `me`. "same" receives a shorter brief because it is more common than the name Sam.
- `SE`: "see" - Speed and Convinence.
- `S-FP`: "such" - The `S-` prefix represents `s`, and `-FP` might represent the `ch` sound.
- `S-PBS`: "since" - The `S-` prefix represents `s`, and `-PBS` represent the `nce`.
- `S-L`: "school" - Speed and Convinence.
- `TKPWR-P`: "group" - The combination of `TKPWR` phonetically represent `gr`, and `-P` the ending `p`.
- `TKPWR-T`: "great" - Building on the previous shorthand, `-T` represent the ending `t`.
- `TKPW-F`: "give" - Building on the previous shorthand,`-F` represents the ending `ve`.
- `TKA`: "take" - Speed and Convinence.
- `TK-PB`: "down" - The `TK-` prefix represent the `d`, and `-PB` the `own`.
- `TPH-PL`: "number" - The `TPH` represent the `n`, and `-PL` the `m`.
- `TP-FT`: "first" - The `TP-` prefix represents `f`, and `-FT` represents the `irst`.
- `THES`: "these" - Phonetically, `THES` represents "these".
- `TH-G`: "thing" - The `TH-` prefix represents `th`, and `-G` represents the ending `g`.
- `TA`: "that" - Phonetically, `TA` represents "that".
- `T-PL`: "time" - The `T-` prefix represents `t`, and `-PL` represent the `ime`.
- `KPH`: "make" - `PH` represents `m` and `K` represents `K`. By violating the steno order for this very common word, we can craft make with a one-handed comfortable to press `KPH`.
- `KPH-S`: "makes" - Building on the previous shorthand, `-S` represents the ending `s`.
- `KPH-D`: "made" - Building on the previous shorthand, `-D` represents the past tense.
- `KH-PBG`: "change" - The `KH` represent the `ch`, and `-PBG` the `nge`.
- `KH-LD`: "child" - The `KH` represents the `ch`, and `-LD` the `ld`.
- `K*RS`: "increase" - `K*RS` phonetically represents the sound of "increase".
- `K*RT`: "decrease" - "decrease" could be assigned to `K*RD`, but that would just be harder to reach. `T` is easier to reach and just above `S`, which is for increase.
- `PWAOEPB`: "been" - Phonetically, `PWAOEPB` represents "been".
- `PWO`: "both" - Phonetically, `PWO` represents "both".
- `PWEPB`: "Ben" - Phonetically, `PWEPB` represents "Ben". 
- `PW-PB`: "between" - The `PW-` prefix represent the `be`, and `-PB` the `en`.
- `PH`: "many" - `PH` represents `m`, and "many" has a more intensive stroke compared to other common words like make, so the base m brief is assigned to many.
- `PHO`: "more" - Speed and Convinence.
- `PR`: "from" - Speed and Convinence.
- `PROB`: "problem" - What's your prob?
- `PR-T`: "present" - The `PR-` prefix represent `pr`, and `-T` the `ent`.
- `PR-TS`: "presentation" - Building on the previous shorthand, the additional `-S` represents the `ation`.
- `PUBL`: "public" - Phonetically, `PUBL` represents "public".
- `P-R`: "for" - Phonetically, `P-R` represents "for".
- `P-RPB`: "person" - The `P-` prefix represent the `p`, and `-RPB` the `rson`.
- `P-T`: "point" - Speed and Convinence.
- `P-D`: "find" - Speed and Convinence.
- `WRER`: "year" - Speed and Convinence.
- `WOD`: "word" - Phonetically, `WOD` represents "word".

- `W-BG`: "work" - The `W-` prefix represents `w`, and `-BG` represents the `k`.
- `W-L`: "while" - The `W-` prefix represents `wh`, and `-L` the ending `le`.
- `W-D`: "world" - The `W-` prefix represents `w`, and `-D` represents the `d`. Now granted, the original `WORLD` isn't very hard to type, but this would just be for the Speed and Convinence.

- `HR-F`: "leave" - The `HR-` prefix represent the `le`, and `-F` the `ve`.
- `HR-PB`: "line" - The `HR-` prefix represent the `li`, and `-PB` the `ne`.

## Additional Entries

There are entries that are not within the English 200 word list in MonkeyType. These entries fall into two categories:

1. **Swapped Briefs:** Some briefs have been swapped for speed and convenience reasons.
   - `license` vs `line`: The original Lapwing/Plover brief for `license` is `HR-PB`, while `line` is `HRAOUEUPB`. For speed and convenience, `license` is changed to `HR-PBS`.

2. **Related to Specific Words:** Some entries are related to specific words in the list.
   - `make` vs `makes` vs `made`: Since `make` is within the top 200 words, it's adjusted to the shorthand `KPH`, allowing `KPH-S` and `KPH-D` to represent `makes` and `made` respectively.
   - `increase` vs `decrease`: For easier typing, a simplified version is used: `K*RS` for `increase` and `K*RT` for `decrease`.
